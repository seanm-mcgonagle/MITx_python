# MITx_python
This is a repository containing code related to MITx 6.00.1x, a course provided by MIT through edx.org, covering the basics of computer programming in Python along with the fundamentals of computation. 

The majority of the scripts you will find here are small example problems, usually highlighting a particular topic in python. The problem sets, however, are much larger projects. They use the naming convention ps<problem_set_number>.py, e.g. ps1.py, ps2.py ... ps<x>.py.
